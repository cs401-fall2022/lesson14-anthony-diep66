                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript was originally made as a simple scripting language for websites. Small snippets of 
Javascript were used to introduce user interaction with the website and anything more than that was
considered unusual. As time went on and with the massive growth of "the web", Javascript became 
increasingly popular among developers. What started as small, embedded javascript code hidden inside browsers
evolved into applications such as node.js being created.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Javascript could however use some improvements. For one, Javascript produces some rather unexpected
behaviors when different types of literals are compared.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    if( "" == 0 ){</br>
                        //returns true here</br>
                    }
                </pre>
                
                <p>
                    Perhaps for someone that programs in C++ or Java, this is rather unusual as the compairison amongst
                    differing types of variables are being compared, that is, a string literal to a number literal. Another
                    odd quality of Javascript are the accessing properties of objects
                </p>
                <pre>
                    const obj = {
                        x: 10;
                    }
                    
                    //successfully executes, undefined
                    obj.printSomething();   
                </pre>
                <p>
                    One last point to make is Javascript's pure dynamic typing. Given the intentionally vague 
                    Javascript code:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    message.toLowerCase();
                    message();
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Here, there are a couple of things to consider:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Is message callable?</li>
                    <li>Is toLowerCase() a function of message?</li>
                    <li>If so, is toLowerCase() a callable function?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Due to Javascript's dynamic typing, the interpreter can't answer any of these questions. Perhaps 
                    message was actually a string. In that case, message() certainly wouldn't make sense. The only
                    way to find out is to run the code and see what happens, there are no static type checking available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, introducing Typescript, a superset of Javascript that introduces static type checking 
                    and enforces a stricter set of rules towards the usage of types. Division by zero, invalid
                    array access, and the previously mentioned unusual behaviors of Javascript are all addressed 
                    in Typescript. 
                </p>
                
                <h2>Types</h2>
                <p>
                    This idea extends to creating objects or interfaces with inferred types
                </p>
                <div id="split-table">
                    <div id="side">
                        <h4>Example with Object</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                            const user = {
                                name: "Hayes", 
                                id: 0,
                            }; 
                        </blockquote>

                    <div id="side">
                        <h4>Example with inferred types</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                            interface User{
                                name: string;
                                id: number;
                            } 
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Composing Types</h3>
                <p>
                    There are 2 ways of composing types:
                </p>
                <div id="split-table">
                    <div id="side">
                        <h4>Unions:</h4>
                        type MyBool = true | false;
                    </div>
                    <div id="side">
                        <h4>Generics:</h4>
                        <p>type NumberArray = Array&ltstring&gt;</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Structural Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Typescript also has a thing called <u>duck typing</u> where objects with the same shape are considered to be the same type
                </p>
                <div id="code-snippet">
                    <pre>
                        interface Point{
                            x: number;
                            y: number;
                        }

                        function logPoint(p: Point){
                            &lt!--
                                do something 
                            --&gt
                        }
                        const point = {x: 12, y: 26;}
                        logPoint(point)
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Here, calling logPoint on the point objected that was created will not throw any errors and TypeScript recognizes the point object to be of the Point interface type.
